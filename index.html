            <p>- Get each car to its destination without crashing into any other cars!</p>
            <p>- Each of the larger colored blocks represents a car.</p>
            <p>- Each car has a destination represented by a small dot the same color as the car.</p>
            <p>- Drag each car along the path you want it to drive to get to its destination. Once you have given each car a path to follow, click the 'Move Cars' button or push the space bar and they will all drive along their paths.</p>
            <p>- A car will stop moving once it touches its destination (but can still be collided with, so be careful).</p>
            <p>- After a few levels, some cars will move along their path faster than others.</p>
            <p>- Left clicking on a car that already has a path drawn will erase the existing path and start drawing a new one.</p>
            <p>- Right clicking on a car that already has a path drawn will toggle whether or not the path is visible, but won't erase it.</p>
